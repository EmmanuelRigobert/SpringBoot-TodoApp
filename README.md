  Features:
  
      User Authentication: Users can log in to manage their to-do items.
      CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete to-do items.
      Form Validation: Ensures that to-do items have valid descriptions and deadlines.
      Navigation: Users can navigate between different views, such as the list of to-do items and the form for creating or updating a to-do item.
      Error Handling: Precise errors are shown, and success messages are displayed to the user.


Technologies:

    React 19.0: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    React Router: For handling navigation between different views.
    Formik: For managing form state and validation of forms.
    Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
    useState and useEffect: React hooks for managing state and side effects.
    Spring Boot 3.4 : A Java-based framework for building backend services.
    Spring Security: For handling user authentication and authorization.
    Spring Data JPA: For interacting with H2 database.
    RESTful API: The backend exposes a RESTful API for managing to-do items, which the frontend interacts with.

Project Structure:

    Frontend: Located in the React-TodoApp repository.
    Backend: Implemented using Spring Boot, exposing endpoints for CRUD operations on to-do items.


This project demonstrates a full-stack application with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend, leveraging modern web development technologies to provide a seamless user experience.
